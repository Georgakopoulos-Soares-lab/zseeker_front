            ZSeeker is committed to your privacy. We want to make it clear that our service <strong>does not collect or store any personal data</strong>. Our system is designed to accept job submissions, process them on the server in real-time, and return the results directly to you without saving any data.
            </p>
            
            <h3>1. Data Collection and Storage</h3>
            <p>ZSeeker does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data. We do not maintain a database or any persistent storage for user information. Every job submitted is processed immediately and the results are returned without retaining any details.</p>
            
            <h3>2. How Data is Processed</h3>
            <p>When you submit a job, it is handled by our server and the corresponding results are sent back to you instantly. No logs or user data are stored beyond the scope of that transaction.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Data Access and Third-Party Transfers</h3>
            <p>Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no access granted to any administrators or third parties, and no data is transferred externally.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Cookies and Third-Party Resources</h3>
            <p>While ZSeeker may use cookies strictly for essential website functionality, these cookies do not collect any personal data. Additionally, third-party resources (such as <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a>, <a href="https://datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap5">Bootstrap 5 Datatables</a>, and <a href="https://chartjs.org/">ChartJS</a>) operate under their own data policies. We do not share any user information with them.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Because ZSeeker does not collect, store, or retain any personal data, there are no data privacy rights applicable regarding personal information. Every transaction is ephemeral, ensuring complete privacy.</p>
            
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please visit our <a href="/about.html">About</a> page.</p>
